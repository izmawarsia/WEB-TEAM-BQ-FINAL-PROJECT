    overview: `Our Python Beginner Course is designed for absolute newcomers with no prior coding experience. This course starts from the very basicsâ€”covering how to set up Python, write your first program, and understand core programming concepts like variables, data types, loops, and functions. With hands-on exercises and real-world examples, students will gain confidence in writing and understanding simple Python code.

By the end of the course, learners will be able to build small projects, debug code, and apply their knowledge to practical tasks such as data handling, basic automation, or simple app development. This course provides a solid foundation for anyone looking to pursue a career in programming, data science, or web development, or simply wanting to add a valuable skill to their toolkit.

In addition to interactive lessons, the course includes quizzes, assignments, and guided projects to reinforce learning. Students will also get access to downloadable resources and mentorship support, making it easier to stay motivated and progress at their own pace.`,
